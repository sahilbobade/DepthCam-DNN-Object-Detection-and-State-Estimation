# Object Detection and Size Estimation with Intel RealSense

## Overview
This project utilizes the Intel RealSense camera to detect objects within its field of view, estimate their sizes, and provide precise coordinates. It is designed for applications requiring spatial awareness and object interaction, making it ideal for robotics, automated navigation systems, and environmental monitoring.

## Features
- **Real-Time Object Detection**: Leverages the advanced capabilities of the Intel RealSense camera to detect objects in real-time.
- **Size Estimation**: Estimates the dimensions of detected objects, providing essential data for various applications.
- **Coordinate Mapping**: Calculates and outputs the coordinates of each detected object relative to the camera’s position.

## Technology
This project is developed using:
- Intel RealSense Camera
- ROS
- Libresense
- OpenCV
